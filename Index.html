    <h2 class="underline">So what is CSS?</h2>

    <p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language.
    <br>It's not a markup language either.
    <br>CSS is a style sheet language.
    <br>CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.
    <br>For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red: With our online editor.
    <br>You can edit the CSS, and click on a button to view the result.</p>

    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png" alt="Anatomy of CSS Ruleset" width="400"/>
     
    <p>The main parts of a CSS ruleset are as follows:</p>

    <table>

        <tr>
           <td><strong>Selector</strong></td>

           <td>This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, elements). To style a different element, change the selector.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><strong>Declaration</strong></td>

            <td>This is a single rule like color: red; It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><strong>Properties</strong></td>

            <td>These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><strong>Value</strong></td>

            <td>To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</td>
        </tr>

    </table>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong>The other important parts of the syntax:</p>

    <ol>

        <li>	Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({}).</li>
        <li>	Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
        <li>	Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>

    </ol>
  
    <H2>Summary</H2>

    <p>
        In Summary, CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document and CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed. Five elements that are most important are as follows.   
    </p>

    <ul>

        <li> <strong>width</strong> (of an element).</li>
        <li> <strong>Background-color</strong> behind an element's content and padding.</li>
        <li> <strong>Color</strong>, the color of an element's content (usually text).</li>
        <li> <strong>Text-shadow</strong> sets a drop shadow on the text inside an element.</li>
        <li> <strong>Display</strong> sets the display mode of an element. (Keep reading to learn more).</li>

    </ul>
